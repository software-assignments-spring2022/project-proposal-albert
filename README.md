# Project Proposal

### Project title
NYU Course Explorer

### What and why?
What software system would you like to build this semester, and why?  Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important.

We all extensively use albert for course exploring, but students suffer from albert that it is slow, and messy. We want to built a faster, cleaner version of albert and more powerful features on it. Our ultimate goal is to make an new nyu course explorer that all nyu student will be using it. 

### For whom?
Who will this software be for?  These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users.  Tell us who they are.  For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not.

This software is for NYU students.

### How?
A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective.  Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

### Scope
A brief justification that the proposal is neither too easy nor too ambitions for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester.

1.Remake basic features of albert but in a more elegant way. Make the web dynamic instead of reloading thousands lines of html code on each click.

2.Add more powerful features. Like course tracking system, personalized course planning schedule, deep learning models to predict if can finally join the course from the waitlist...
