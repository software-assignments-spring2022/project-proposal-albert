## Project title

CodeHunt (a coding calendar app)

## What and why?
<!-- What software system would you like to build this semester, and why?  Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important. -->
We will build an information hub for computer scientists. For example, there are many different cs online contest websites, such as Leetcode, Codeforces, Kaggle, etc. And there are many events/contests happening on them. It's inconvenient to keep track of all events by jumping from website to website. So we want to build a webapp to collect and aggregate all the information so that users don't have to open dozens of pages. All they need to do is open our website and see what they are interested in and click the link. 

In the future, we will try to add more powerful features, like job opportunities. And even let user self-define the information they want to keep track of.

## For whom?
<!-- Who will this software be for?  These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users.  Tell us who they are.  For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not. -->
The end-users are NYU Computer Science students. Our plan is to provide limited service to CS department students. We will extend the service to any student seeking Software Engineering related job positions. If resources allowed, we will extend the service to the internet.

## How?
<!-- A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective.  Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work. -->
For the information retrival process, we will be using web crawler or retrieval via API. For end-user consumption, we intent on building either a webapp or (maybe) a browser extension that will at the very least hold a list of events happening on the multiple platforms. 

Additional potential features we would like to incorporate are listed below:
- user-specific settings to toggle which websites they want to be notified about
- ability to hide events that users are not interested in
- integration with calendar apps such as Google Calendar or Apple Calendar

## Scope

The general premise of the app is relatively simple, with the only challenge being how we will be able to retieve data (the solution to this may vary depending on the website). However, once we get the essential parts of the project finished, we have a lot of potential for refining quality-of-life, such as the additional features listed above. This, combined with the fact that the project idea is both practical and effective, leads us to believe that it is a good app to work on.
