# Project Proposal

## Project title


## What and why?
<!-- What software system would you like to build this semester, and why?  Include a description of what problem the system would solve and why this is important. -->
We will build an information hub for cs people. For example, there are many differnet cs online contest websites, such as leetcode, codeforce, kaggle. And there are many events/contests happening on them. It's very hard to keep track of all those informations. So we want to build a website to collect and aggregate all the information, so that users don't have to open dozens of pages. All they need to do is open our website and see what they are interested in and click the link. 

In the future, we will try to add more powerful features, like job opportunities. And even let user self-define the information they want to keep track of.


## For whom?
<!-- Who will this software be for?  These people are your end-users or customers.

Do not make software for imaginary users who do not exist - you must have real people as your initial end-users.  Tell us who they are.  For example, is it for a particular type of business, mass consumer, a campus office, a professor, or friends or family, or ... people just like you.

Understanding who your end-users are, and ideally speaking with some along the way, will help you refine your designs to be suitable for your audience, and understand whether you have succeeded at the end or not. -->
The end-users are NYU Computer Science students. Our plan is to provide limited service to CS department students. We will extend the service to any student seeking Software Engineering related job positions. If resources allowed, we will extend the service to the internet.

## How?
<!-- A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective.  Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work. -->
